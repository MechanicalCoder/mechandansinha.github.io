      <p>Hi there! My name is Chandan Sinha. I'm a final year student in Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering Dept. at IIT Hyderabad. </p>
<p>I hail from Dhanbad - a serene place in Jharkhand state of India. I like to experiment and fervently believe in practical learning. I didn't like the mundane teaching methodologies in the classes much, so I started to learn things on my own. I like to conceive new ideas and act upon them. Zeal and excitement toward Science &amp; Technology is much valued in my humble world and I would love to share my craziness with like-minded. </p>
<p>This techblog is a good medium to share my learning experiences as I observe and build things. Hope you enjoy your visit here :)</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me if you would like to say something or just stop by to greet 'hi!'. </p>
